# youtube-dl

youtube-dl is a open-source software to download videos without paying from YouTube. Due to conflicts with the RIAA, it was taken down by DMCA. But in my opinion and in that of hundreds of other people, youtube-dl is important, especially for journalists. So I uploaded the files on my GitHub.

## How to run

If you use Windows, just run the .exe file with the right arguments.
In Linux, run "chmod a+x youtube-dl" and then run "./youtube-dl" with the right arguments.
You could also download the .gz package and build it yourself.
Notice that, exept for Windows, you need to have Python installed!
